Imports your Flickr sets, collections, tags, comments, and full-size original photos into your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Connect to your Flickr account and import your photos and data into your WordPress site. This plugin imports the following data from Flickr:

* Photos (full-size originals including EXIF data)
* Collections
* Sets
* Tags
* Comments
* Dates and times

It does not import notes, people, locations (geotags), or groups.

It is highly recommended you run this importer with a Flickr Pro account. Without Flickr Pro you can only import your most recent 200 photos and will not be able to download your original photos.

This plugin does not provide any features for displaying your photos and data. It is up to you to modify your theme to accomplish this. The [[gallery] short code](http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode) is another option.

== Installation ==

Use the plugin installer built into WordPress.
